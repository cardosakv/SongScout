## SongScout
school project: music data tool for retrieving data from Spotify including streams

Latest Update: There are still semantic errors which were not resolved because of the deadline of submission for finals. The data will really take time to load since it was retrieved directly from the API. Bigger discographies, more time to load. Incorporation of a database that is refreshed daily can be done.
